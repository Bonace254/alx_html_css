- Apply consistent styling using fonts, colors, and spacing.

## Figma Design

- Duplicate the design to your drafts: [Figma Design Page](#)
- Download Figma file: [Design .fig](#)

## Fonts Used

- [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/spin-cycle)

## Notes

- Some sizes are floats; you can round them.
- Ensure your `index.html` reflects the layout and visuals in the Figma.
