> ⚠️ Duplicate the file to your Figma drafts to access editing and inspection.

If you can’t access the main file, use the fallback Figma file provided by ALX.

- **Fonts Used**:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fontspace.com/spin-cycle-font-f12754)

> Make sure to install the fonts locally for accurate visual matching.
